## Motivation

The application service remains one of the oldest pieces of code in the framework and has remained largely untouched for years. In its original form, the application service *did* support multiple **app** components, but was removed to resolve [#9797](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/commit/59a6bbf8cf02a8e1565db6b268741c7c655c0176).

This RFC aims to normalize the layout process for participating components as well as expanding the possible layout combinations the user can create.
